From nginx official docs:

- Setting up Reverse Proxy server: https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/

- Setting up Load Balancing server: https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/load-balancer/http-load-balancer/

**TIP: Use watch binary in this folder to restart nginx server over every change in `nging.conf` file, so we it would be easy to develope the config file and detect error ASAP.**
